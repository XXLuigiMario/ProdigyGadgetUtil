# ProdigyGadgetUtil
A Bukkit/Spigot plugin which allows you to create ProdigyGadget crates in CrateReloaded.

## Building
This project requires third-party dependencies (some of which are paid), you can find them here:
* [ClientStats](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clientstats-bukkit-spigot.24329/)
* [ProdigyGadget](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prodigygadget-diamond.1335/)
* [PermissionsEx](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex)
* [CrateReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mystery-crate-cratereloaded-for-the-finest-servers.3663/)

For building with Maven, place them outside the project's directory in a folder called 'Libs' or modify the pom.xml

## WIP
In order to work this project requires a version of CrateReloaded which has not yet been made public,
as it makes use of an API which is currently in development.
